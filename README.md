# UnityToolbox
A toolbox with scripts that can be used in unity.
Currently this includes:

- Localisation system
- Dialog system
- Inventory system (To be reworked soon)
- Savegame management (Checkpoint data and saving of objects at runtime)
- Procedual terrain generation
- Player controls for 2D and 3D
- Settings management (Controls, volume and languages)
- Sound management

Documentation is in its works and will soon be available externally.
