A few scripts underlay a naming convention. These are:
- ...Interaction.cs for player triggered interactions with GameObjects.
- ...Button.cs for any UI related buttons.
- ...Control.cs for any input related scripts, that execute on a pressed key.
- The context of the script is always within the name.

The documentation excludes private members and EditorWindow implementations.\n
**Currently the toolbox is not in a stable version and requires polishing, which is currently being worked on.**\n
**The same goes for the tutorials and non code related documentation.**
